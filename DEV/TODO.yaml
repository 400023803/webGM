add tiles

auto-find hex colors ($BBGGRR)/(#RRGGBB), replace/define with JS hex color ("#RRGGBB")/("#RRGGBB")
    UNDERTALE COLORS FIX (JS) BELOW
    window.$FFA914 = "#14A9FF"
    window.$FDC00E = "#0EC0FD"
    window.$D4BBFF = "#FFBBD4"
    window.$231318 = "#181323"

add on to scope variables
    "self" - current scope (can change within "with" statements)
    "other" - other scope (previous scope in with statement, or other instance in collision event - if neither applies, it's the same as "self")

code between Step and EndStep events (order matters)
    move instances (hspeed, vspeed, <paths>)
    check collison - if 2 things collide and 1 is solid then they both move to their previous frame's position, collision events called for both

sounds stop working sometimes (temporarily)
    maybe a website security restriction? hopefully not
    fix at some point of possible
