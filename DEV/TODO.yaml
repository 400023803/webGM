fix titlescreen freezing when "begin game" clicked
    game uses while loop for inputs, freezes JS
fix introlast sprite - ?

finish tiles/backgrounds
    import data from rooms about which backgrounds and tiles they use (if any)

    render tiles in main.js
    also add functions - tile_layer_show(), tile_layer_hide(), tile_layer_shift()

allow importing/exporting filesystems to computer (fileSystem and fileSystemStr variables, stored as actual file/directory structure, separated for each game)

auto-find hex colors ($BBGGRR)/(#RRGGBB), replace/define with JS hex color ("#RRGGBB")/("#RRGGBB")
    UNDERTALE COLORS FIX (JS) BELOW
    window.$FFA914 = "#14A9FF"
    window.$FDC00E = "#0EC0FD"
    window.$D4BBFF = "#FFBBD4"
    window.$231318 = "#181323"

add on to scope variables
    "self" - current scope (can change within "with" statements)
    "other" - other scope (previous scope in with statement, or other instance in collision event - if neither applies, it's the same as "self")

add code between Step and EndStep events (order matters)
    move instances (hspeed, vspeed, <paths>)
    check collison - if 2 things collide and 1 is solid then they both move to their previous frame's position, collision events called for both

sounds stop working sometimes (temporarily)
    maybe a website security restriction? hopefully not
    fix at some point if possible
